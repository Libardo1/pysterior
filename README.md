# pysterior

`pysterior` is a machine learning library for Python which aims to make Bayesian parametric regression and classification models accessible and easy to use. The library allows users to construct supervised learning models using an intuitive interface similar to that used by [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn).

Under the hood, `pysterior` uses the implementation of the [No-U-Turn Sampler (Hoffman and Gelman, 2011)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4246) provided by the thoroughly wonderful [pymc3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3). Pymc3 is a requirement to run `pysterior`.

Coming soon:
* An alpha release on PyPI
* Examples of regression models with `pysterior`
